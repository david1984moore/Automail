# üöÄ Automail Processing Upgrade Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Content Security Policy (CSP) Violations
**Problem**: Extension blocked from connecting to cloud server
**Solution**: 
- Updated `manifest.json` to include cloud server permissions
- Added `https://automail-ai-server-506990861082.us-east4.run.app/*` to host_permissions
- Added `https://*.run.app/*` for future flexibility
- Updated CSP in manifest to allow cloud connections

### 2. ‚ùå 500 Email Storage Limit
**Problem**: Extension artificially limited to 500 emails
**Solution**: 
- Removed `MAX_STORED_EMAILS_COUNT = 500` constant
- Replaced hard limit with intelligent storage management
- Now keeps metadata for all emails but archives heavy content after 1000 emails
- Users can now process unlimited emails

### 3. ‚ùå Continuous Processing Not Stopping
**Problem**: Processing continued even when all emails were processed
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced completion detection logic
- Added `allEmailsProcessed` and `lastBatchSize` tracking
- Improved auto-stop conditions when no new emails found
- Better differentiation between 'active' and 'monitoring' modes

### 4. ‚ùå New Email Detection Issues
**Problem**: System didn't properly restart processing for new emails
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced new email detection in `processNewEmails()`
- Auto-restart active processing when new emails arrive
- Reset completion flags when new emails detected
- Better monitoring mode for ongoing email surveillance

### 5. ‚ùå Batch Classification Failures
**Problem**: CSP violations caused complete classification failures
**Solution**: 
- Automatic fallback to rule-based classification
- Better error handling in batch processing
- Enhanced classification result processing
- Graceful degradation when cloud AI unavailable

## New Features

### üìä Intelligent Storage Management
- Keeps all email metadata permanently
- Archives heavy content for emails beyond recent 1000
- Significantly reduced storage footprint
- Maintains full functionality

- Better pagination handling
- Enhanced completion detection
- Reduced API quota usage

## Technical Improvements

### üîß Error Handling
- Comprehensive fallback mechanisms
- Better CSP violation handling
- Graceful degradation for network issues
- Enhanced logging and debugging

### üíæ Storage Optimization
